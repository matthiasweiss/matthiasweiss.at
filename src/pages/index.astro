      I'm a full stack developer from Vienna, Austria. I especially like the
      full stack aspect, since I really enjoy building applications across the
      entire stack. Whether it's frontend, backend, or infrastructure, I enjoy
      all of it. I've worked with various programming languages and frameworks
      over the years, but the one I always come back to is Laravel. Even though
      I'd prefer to work in a more type-safe language, I haven't found any
      stacks where I'm remotely as productive as I am in Laravel. I listed some
      of my recent projects <a href="/projects">here</a>.
