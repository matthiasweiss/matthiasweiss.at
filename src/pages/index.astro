      I'm a software engineer from Vienna, Austria. As a full stack engineer, I
      like all aspects of building web applications. Whether it's frontend,
      backend, or infrastructure, I enjoy all parts of the process. I've worked
      with various programming languages and frameworks over the years, but the
      one I always come back to is Laravel. Even though I'd prefer to work in a
      more type-safe language than PHP, I haven't found any stacks where I'm
      remotely as productive as I am in Laravel. Take a look at some of my
      recent work <a href={PATHS.WORK}>here</a> or on
      <a href="https://github.com/matthiasweiss" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. 👨‍💻

      One of these projects is this website. I revamped it in early 2025 to give
      it a more modern look, and also to use it as an excuse to get into
      blogging. My goal is to share things that I learn and think are worth
      sharing with others, all in a digestible format. If you're interested, you
      can check out my posts <a href="/blog">here</a>. ✏️
