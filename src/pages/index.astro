    <p class="prose dark:prose-invert">
      I'm a software engineer from Vienna, Austria. I really enjoy building full
      stack web applications. Whether it's frontend, backend, or infrastructure,
      I enjoy all of it. I've worked with various programming languages and
      frameworks over the years, but the one I always come back to is Laravel.
      Even though I'd prefer to work in a more type-safe language, I haven't
      found any stacks where I'm remotely as productive as I am in Laravel. Take
      a look at some of my recent projects <a href="/projects">here</a> or on
      <a href="https://github.com/matthiasweiss" target="_blank">GitHub</a> 👨‍💻

      I built this website that you're currently looking at in early 2025. On
      one hand I wanted to give the site a more modern look, and on the other, I
      wanted to get into blogging. My goal is to share things that I learn and
      think are worth sharing with others, all in a digestible format. If you're
      interested, you can check out my posts <a href="/projects">here</a>. ✏️
