      I'm currently working as a full stack developer at <a
        href="https://www.viable.at/"
        target="_blank">viable</a
      >. I get to work with various technologies and frameworks simultaneously,
      which I really enjoy. Lately, there's been a lot of React, Angular, Spring
      Boot, and AWS.
      <br />
      Before I joined viable in 2023, I was a frontend developer at
      <a href="https://asqs.net/" target="_blank">ASQS</a>, where I
      predominantly used Angular. On some, very rare, occasions, I also got to
      work with Laravel.
      <br />
      I've also been trying to work on personal projects more over the last few years.
      Some of my favorite ones are listed below. ⬇️
    </p>

    <p class="prose dark:prose-invert">
      <a href="https://github.com/nicebucket-org/nicebucket">nicebucket</a> is a
      fast, private, and open-source GUI for S3-compatible storages. 🪣
      <br />
      I created it with my good friend <a href="https://github.com/itsboogie"
        >Philip</a
      > using Tauri and React. Tauri turned out to be a very interesting technology
      and a good fit for our use case. While the development would have definitely
      been faster with Electron (since we could have used TypeScript for the backend
      instead of Rust), I do not regret going with Tauri at all. The app feels snappy,
      the binary is fairly small, and getting back into Rust was a lot of fun as
      well.

    <p class="prose dark:prose-invert">
      <a href="https://www.breakfreeapp.net/">Break Free</a> is an iOS app that helps
      people quit bad habits such as smoking, drinking or gambling. 🙅
      <br />
      It is my first ever native app and I built it using React Native and Expo.
      Being primarily a web developer, this choice turned out to be a great fit for
      me.

    <p class="prose dark:prose-invert">
      <span class="italic">SimpleChore</span> was an app that made it easy to schedule
      your meals and grocery shopping trips for the week. 🍝
      <br />
      The stack I used to implement SimpleChore is Laravel and React, connected through
      Inertia. The frontend heavily uses Tailwind and shadcn/ui. I retired it in
      October of 2025, since it did not have any active users anymore.
    </p>

    <p class="prose dark:prose-invert">
      <span class="italic">Pump Up Not Out</span> was an app and browser extension
      that helps people quit porn in favor of working out. 💪
      <br />
      It worked by redirecting you to the app whenever you try to visit a website
      with pornographic content. Once redirected, the app motivates you to do a quick
      set of pushups, pullups or squats. The tech stack was identical to SimpleChore:
      Laravel, React, Inertia, Tailwind, shadcn/ui. I also retired it in October
      of 2025.

        I've also had the chance to contribute to a few open source projects,
        which I think is a very cool experience. I'd certainly like to do it
        more often, but I try to limit contributions to issues I run into,
        rather than contributing for the sake of it. Some of most memorable
        contributions are the following:
